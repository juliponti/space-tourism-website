## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TAILWIND CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

First and foremost I would like to continue practising tailwind CSS and its correct implementation. Also, I found extremely challenging the correct use of the responsive design in all screen sizes which is why is one of the areas I would like to improve the performance.

### Useful resources

- [Hamburger Icon](https://hamburger-react.netlify.app/) - This helped with the hamburger icon and its animation.
- [Rem a Px conversor](https://nekocalc.com/es/rem-a-px-conversor) - Since Tailwind CSS uses REM a lot this page help me to covert these measures.
